## Documentation

The documentation is available at <https://saidsay-so.github.io/scattack>,
with the report available at <https://saidsay-so.github.io/scattack/report.html>
or for the PDF format <https://saidsay-so.github.io/scattack/index.pdf>.

## Development

### Setup

Ensure that you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.
It is recommended to use a virtual environment for development along with the `pdm` package manager.

```bash
cd scattack
pdm install -G:all
pdm use --venv in-project
sudo python -m scattack.gui
```

If you are using `pip` instead of `pdm`, you can install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
cd scattack
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
sudo python -m scattack.gui
```
